			<h3> FreedomWriter01</h3>
			
			<p class="proPara"> What's Up? My name is John and as my profile name suggest freedom is my game. However if you think the only 
			freedom that I'm concerned with is freedom of people, your gravely mistaken? Don't know what I'm talking about. Guess you'll
			have to find out by reading one of the many discussions I'm in. PEACE!
