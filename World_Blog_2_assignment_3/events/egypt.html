	<h2> Cario</h2>
	<p>
   When Egyptians ejected a head of state for the second time 
   in little over two years, much was made of the political and 
   religious reasons for the revolt against Mohamed Morsi.

			<em>Guest1</em>: I totally agree with you MotoLover101! It's wrong that people are killed based on their beliefs. Here something I found that I think you should both check out.

		Many other things could have been done instead of going and killing supporters. I support democracy. If 49% or 48% didn't want Morsi, maybe some kind of a re-election 
		should had happened as opposed to a military take over.

		Those people deserve to be in jail, the country still has rules that people <strong>MUST</strong> follow.

		Do you realize how many people got killed! Morsi's supporters are either dead or in jail!

		<q>Why was <strong>military take over </strong>their first choice?</q> <br> Did you consider that it was probably the only choice they had? Also who knows what could have happened to the country if he stayed in power.
		although it's horrible to see the lost of so many lives, it was the necessary choice!

		I admit that Morsi probably wasn't the best leader. However, getting him off the leader chair could have been handled a better way. Why was <strong>military take over </strong>their first choice?
		It was a choice that ended up taking many innocent lives. Why couldn't they just wait till his term was finished?

		When Morsi was the leader, he wanted to take over with his party, The Muslim brotherhood, He didn't care what the people wanted. Instead
	     he wanted to change the country to be an Islamic country, which is just not acceptable!
