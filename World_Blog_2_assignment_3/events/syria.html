		<blockquote>
			Estimates of <strong>Deaths in the Syrian Civil War</strong>,<br>
			per opposition activist groups,vary between 118,500 and 180,215.<br>
			On 22 August 2014, the United Nations put out an estimate of over<br>
			191,000 that had died in the war.

			Opposition are trying to give the people their country back.
			It use to be one of the most beautiful countries out there. People were living a good life, in peace. most importantly
