		The attack of the USA on Iraq had its pros and its cons. Many people were supporting the attack to 
		<q>free</q> the Iraqi nation from Saddam Hussain while others were opposed to the idea. What do you think?

		Think about it. Before USA attacked Iraq - Iraq was perfectly fine. The people of Iraq had jobs, they had money. 
		People were living their everyday life, maybe not the best life but most of the people were happy.

		<q><strong>Saddam was a great leader</strong></q>. I can't even believe you just said that! He was the exact
		opposite of a great leader. If you think that ruling Iraq with an iron first and 
		<a title="The Dujail Massacre of 1982" href="http://civilliberty.about.com/od/internationalhumanrights/p/saddam_hussein.htm#adsense2">slaughtering about 148 residents,
		including dozens of children.</a> defines a great leader. Then I don't want to know what you think a bad leader is.<br>

		Saddam was a great leader. I agree that he caused a <em>little ruckus</em>, but it was for a greater cause.
		He kept the real threat away from Iraq. Many countries wanted the Iraqi oil, and they were willing to go to the extremes to get it.

		Saddam Hussain was a bad leader, he committed many crimes against his own people and against others.
		I can think of a few off the top of my head:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chemical Weapons Against Kurds</li>
		<li>Reprisal Against Dujail</li>
		<li>Anfal Campaign</li>
		<li>Invasion of Kuwait</li>
		<li>Shiite Uprising and the Marsh Arabs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Here's more info if I sparked your interest: 
		<a href="http://history1900s.about.com/od/saddamhussein/a/husseincrimes.htm" title="Info on Saddam's Crimes">Saddam Hussain Crimes</a><br>
		So if you ask me, I think the USA did the right thing attacking him!
