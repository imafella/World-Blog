			As the wise Angelina Jolie once said:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Without pain, there would be no suffering, without suffering we would never learn from
		our mistakes. To make it right, pain and suffering is the key to all windows, without it,
		there is no way of life.
	</blockquote>

		Sometimes the cost needs to be great in order for people to understand.

			But at what cost? It killed more than 2,200 people. Surely to God there must have been a better way!

			Listen all I'm saying is that ever since <strong>Operation Protective Edge</strong> took place the amount of rocket attacks
			on Israel from the Gaza Strip has significantly decreased. If you don't believe me see for yourself at<br>
			<a title="Rocket attack chart" href="http://www.idfblog.com/facts-figures/rocket-attacks-toward-israel/">http://www.idfblog.com/facts-figures/rocket-attacks-toward-israel/</a><br>
			all I'm saying is that the proof is in the pudding.

		I know what I said DestinyFan17 and I stand by it. Do you have any idea how those poor Gazans feel. To be given 
		restricted access to:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Food</li>
		<li>Water</li>
		<li>Electricity</li>
		<li>Gas</li>
		<li>Construction Materials</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	 	I'd be fighting too if they were restricting me of my rights! It has become a humanitarian crisis!

		I think what you meant to say is <q>Why can't Hamas leave the people of Israel alone! </q> If it wasn't for the 
		constant rocket attacks by the Hamas this would have never happen. Israel did what they had to do in order to stop the Hamas
		from destroying more of their home.
